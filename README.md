# About

Hi! I'm David, welcome to my Data Analytical portfolio. 

This repository serves as a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making.

I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an aspiring Data/BI Analyst. I focus on the entire analytical workflow: from querying and cleaning data to building interactive dashboards and telling a compelling story with findings, all of this using SQL, Python, Power BI and Tablueau. 

This portfolio is a testament to my problem-solving approach, attention to detail, and my drive to derive meaningful answers from data. 

Feel free to explore the projects below to see how I apply these tools to real-world business scenarios.
